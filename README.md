    <HomeScreen />
  );
}
```

### Props
This component doesn't accept external props directly; it renders predefined categories in `CategoriesComponent`.

## Code Overview

1. **ScrollView Layout**:
   - A `ScrollView` provides a vertically scrollable interface for viewing all sections.
   - Margin is added at the bottom to ensure spacing.

2. **Component Usage**:
   - The `SearchBar` appears at the top, followed by each section in a sequential order: `CarouselComponent`, `CategoryNav`, `CategoryCard`, `Banner`, `CategoryHero`, and `CategoriesComponent` (which displays multiple predefined categories).

3. **Styles**:
   - The main style `container` aligns items to the center, provides a full-width layout, and sets a white background.

## Example

```javascript
import HomeScreen from './path/to/index';

function App() {
  return <HomeScreen />;
}
```

## Styles

The primary style, `container`, ensures that the layout is centered, full-width, and has a white background color.

---

## Components

### 1. `Index` Component

The `Index` component acts as an entry point for the authentication process. It displays options to either log in or sign up, with a "Skip" option to proceed without authentication.

- **Login Button**: Navigates the user to the `Login` screen for entering credentials.
- **Sign Up Link**: Redirects users to the `Signup` screen if they donâ€™t have an account.
- **Skip Option**: Allows users to bypass authentication and access the main app (tabs view).

#### Key Features
- **Background Image**: Creates an immersive UI by displaying an onboarding image.
- **Link Navigation**: Utilizes Expo Router's `Link` component for navigation between screens.

#### Usage
This component is rendered as part of the initial user flow, guiding users to log in, sign up, or skip authentication.

#### Example
```javascript
import AuthScreen from './path/to/index';
export default function App() {
  return <AuthScreen />;
}
```

### 2. `Login` Component

The `Login` component is the main login interface for existing users.

- **Email and Password Input**: Uses `CustomText` components for email and password fields.
- **Login Button**: Authenticates users using Firebase, displaying error messages for invalid credentials or missing fields.
- **Error Handling**: Provides feedback for various authentication errors (e.g., user not found, incorrect password, invalid email format).
- **Navigation Links**: Includes a link to the `Signup` screen if the user needs to create an account.

#### Key Features
- **Firebase Authentication**: Uses Firebase's `signInWithEmailAndPassword` function for login.
- **Custom Input Components**: `CustomText` fields with icons for a polished UI.
- **Error Alerts**: Inform users about specific issues during login, such as missing fields or incorrect credentials.

#### Usage
This component is typically accessed through the `Index` componentâ€™s Login button.

#### Example
```javascript
import LoginScreen from './path/to/Login';
export default function App() {
  return <LoginScreen />;
}
```

## Installation
Ensure that Firebase is correctly configured by importing and setting up Firebase in `firebaseConfig.js`. Install any necessary dependencies with:
```bash
npm install
```

## Screens and Navigation
The screens are linked using Expo Routerâ€™s `Link` component:
- **Index â†’ Login**: Opens the login screen for credential input.
- **Index â†’ Signup**: Directs to the signup screen for new users.
- **Login â†’ Tabs**: Redirects authenticated users to the main app's tabs view.

## Styling
Both screens use custom styles:
- `Index` and `Login` components share consistent colors and layouts for a unified user experience.
- Shadow and elevation styles are added to buttons for a polished look.
